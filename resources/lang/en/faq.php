    'title' => 'Frequently Asked Questions',
    'howToUseQuestion' => 'How is Barbam’s Elixir used?',
    'howToUseAnswer' => 'The Elixir is applied twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, half a pipette per
						use. The drops are applied directly to the face and are then spread with the fingers. It shouldn’t be poured
						into the hands and then spread. Shake before each use.',
    'beardOilQuestion' => 'Can I use beard oil?',
    'beardOilAnswer' => 'Of course you can use beard oil with the Elixir. It’s important to wait for 5 hours to pass after applying the Elixir, because that’s how long it takes for it to start working. After this, you can use the oil as much as you want.',

    'canIShaveQuestion' => 'Can I shave?',
    'canIShaveAnswer' => 'You should reduce shaving to a minimum. If you really need to shave with a razor, it’s important not to apply the Elixir 3 - 4 hours after shaving. You can trim your beard as needed.',

    'firstResultsQuestion' => 'How long does it take to see the first results?',
    'firstResultsAnswer' => 'The first results can be seen after 4 weeks of regular use of the Elixir. The peak of the beard growth and development is visible during the first 1 to 3 months.
                    The longer you use the Elixir, the better the results will be and the higher quality they’ll have. Don’t forget – The beard that you grow thanks to the Elixir is there to stay.',


    'hairGrowQuestion' => 'Does the Elixir help the hair grow, too?',
    'hairGrowAnswer' => 'We’re currently developing a hair formula. Barbam’s Elixir is exclusively intended for beard growth.',
